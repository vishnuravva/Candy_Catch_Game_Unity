# Candy_Catch_Game_Unity
My First Unity Project.
A game where a player (dragon) uses his reflexive actions to catch candies falling from different random  positions within specific boundaries.
He has 3 lifes in order to save him from game getting over. 
Thereâ€™s also a score counter, as he catches candies score will be incremented.
